Understanding Embeddings

Embeddings are a type of word representation that allows words with similar meaning to have similar vector representations. They are a distributed representation for text that is perhaps one of the key breakthroughs for the impressive performance of deep learning methods on challenging natural language processing problems.

Key Characteristics:
- Dense vectors of real numbers
- Capture semantic relationships
- Reduce dimensionality
- Enable similarity calculations

Word embeddings are useful for tasks like:
- Semantic search
- Document clustering
- Text classification
- Question answering

Popular embedding models include Word2Vec, GloVe, and modern transformer-based models like BERT. These embeddings can capture various linguistic properties and relationships between words.
