Machine Learning: An Introduction

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Reinforcement Learning

Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering, computer vision, and recommendation systems, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms.
